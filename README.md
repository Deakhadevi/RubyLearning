What is Ruby
Ruby is a dynamic, open source, object oriented and reflective programming language. Ruby is considered similar to Perl and Smalltalk programming languages. It runs on all types of platforms like Windows, Mac OS and all versions of UNIX.

It is fully object oriented programming language. Everything is an object in Ruby. Each and every code has their properties and actions. Here properties refer to variables and actions refer to methods.

Ruby is considered to follow the principle of POLA (principle of least astonishment). It means that the language behaves in such a way to minimize the confusion for experienced users.

Features of Ruby
Ruby language has many features. Some of them are explained below:

Features of Ruby
Object-oriented
Flexibility
Expressive feature
Mixins
Visual appearance
Dynamic typing and Duck typing
Exception handling
Garbage collector
Portable
Keywords
Statement delimiters
Variable constants
Naming conventions
Keyword arguments
Method names
Singleton methods
Missing method
Case Sensitive
Object Oriented
Ruby is purely object oriented programming language. Each and every value is an object. Every object has a class and every class has a super class. Every code has their properties and actions. Ruby is influenced with Smalltalk language. Rules applying to objects applies to the entire Ruby.

Flexibility
Ruby is a flexible language as you can easily remove, redefine or add existing parts to it. It allows its users to freely alter its parts as they wish.

Mixins
Ruby has a feature of single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead, a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to inheritance but much more flexible.


Naming conventions
Ruby defines some naming conventions for its variable, method, constant and class.

Constant: Starts with a capital letter.
Global variable: Starts with a dollar sign ($).
Instance variable: Starts with a (@) sign.
Class variable: Starts with a (@@) sign.
Method name: Allowed to start with a capital letter.
Keyword arguments
Like Python, Ruby methods can also be defined using keyword arguments.

Method names
Methods are allowed to end with question mark (?) or exclamation mark (!). By convention, methods that answer questions end with question mark and methods that indicates that method can change the state of the object end with exclamation mark.
