What is Ruby
Ruby is a dynamic, open source, object oriented and reflective programming language. Ruby is considered similar to Perl and Smalltalk programming languages. It runs on all types of platforms like Windows, Mac OS and all versions of UNIX.

It is fully object oriented programming language. Everything is an object in Ruby. Each and every code has their properties and actions. Here properties refer to variables and actions refer to methods.

Ruby is considered to follow the principle of POLA (principle of least astonishment). It means that the language behaves in such a way to minimize the confusion for experienced users.

Features of Ruby
Ruby language has many features. Some of them are explained below:

Object Oriented
Ruby is purely object oriented programming language. Each and every value is an object. Every object has a class and every class has a super class. Every code has their properties and actions. Ruby is influenced with Smalltalk language. Rules applying to objects applies to the entire Ruby.

Flexibility
Ruby is a flexible language as you can easily remove, redefine or add existing parts to it. It allows its users to freely alter its parts as they wish.

Mixins
Ruby has a feature of single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead, a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to inheritance but much more flexible.
